- **Pre-merge**: All tests passing, coverage ≥70%
- **Testing**: 82+ tests, 96%+ coverage

### Frontend Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: npm lint (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors)
- **Pre-merge**: npm test coverage ≥60%, build succeeds
- **Testing**: Jest tests, accessibility checks

## File Structure

### Squads (Agent Teams)
- `.aios-core/development/agent-teams/team-bidiq-backend.yaml` - Backend squad
- `.aios-core/development/agent-teams/team-bidiq-frontend.yaml` - Frontend squad
- `.aios-core/development/agent-teams/team-bidiq-feature.yaml` - Complete feature squad

### Development Guide
- `docs/guides/bidiq-development-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide with examples

### Commands
- `.claude/commands/bidiq.md` - This file (meta-command hub)
- Coming Week 2: Individual command files (status, help, run-tests)
- Coming Week 3: Setup and reporting commands
- Coming Week 4: Deployment and automation commands

---

## Key Concepts

### Squads vs Commands

**Squads (Agent Teams):**
- Multiple agents working together
- Structured workflow with quality gates
- Used for complex, multi-step work
- Example: `team-bidiq-backend` (architect + dev + data-engineer + qa)

**Commands (Quick Actions):**
- Single execution, focused purpose
- Minimal setup required
- Used for quick checks and reports
- Example: `/status` (shows project health)

### Stories & Issues

All development starts with stories in `docs/stories/`:
- Story number (e.g., Story 2.1)
- Title and description
- Acceptance criteria
- Task checklist
- Team assignment

### Quality Gates

Automated checks at multiple stages:
- **Pre-commit**: Local checks before staging
- **Pre-merge**: Final validation before PR merge
- **Pre-deployment**: Production readiness check

---

---

## Troubleshooting

### Squad not activating?
1. Verify squad file exists: `.aios-core/development/agent-teams/team-bidiq-*.yaml`
2. Check agent dependencies are available
3. Try: `/squad-creator` → "Load existing squad"

### Tests failing?
1. Check quality gate thresholds (70% backend, 60% frontend)
2. Run with: `/bidiq run-tests` (coming Week 2)
3. View coverage: `backend/htmlcov/index.html` or `frontend/coverage/`

### Story not visible?
1. Stories located in: `docs/stories/`
2. Story format: `story-{number}-{title}.md`
3. Ask @pm or @sm to create new story
