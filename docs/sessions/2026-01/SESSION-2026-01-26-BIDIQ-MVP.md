## Known Limitations & Future Work

### MVP Limitations
- **Status command:** Coming Week 2 (requires data collection logic)
- **Setup commands:** Coming Week 3 (depends on backend implementation, Issue #17)
- **Frontend setup:** Coming Week 4 (depends on frontend setup, Issue #21)
- **Deploy command:** Coming Week 4 (requires Railway configuration)
- **Automation script:** Coming Week 4 (CLI-based, no interactive prompts)

### Phased Delivery Strategy
This MVP uses **zero-dependency approach**:
- Week 1: Squads + hub + guide (✅ COMPLETE)
- Week 2: Commands using existing code
- Week 3: Commands after backend implementation (Issue #17)
- Week 4: Commands after frontend + Railway setup (Issue #21)

### No Blocking Issues
- All deliverables in Week 1 MVP are complete
- Can be used immediately with existing infrastructure
- No dependencies on backend/frontend implementation
- No breaking changes to existing workflow
