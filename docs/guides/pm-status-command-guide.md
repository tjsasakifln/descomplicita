- **Documentation:** Links to key resources

## Use Cases

### 1. Daily Standup
```bash
*status
```
Quick overview for team sync-ups

### 2. Sprint Planning
```bash
*status

→ *create-epic (to plan next sprint)
```

### 3. Pre-Deployment
```bash
*status
→ Verify deployment readiness (✅ all green)
→ Proceed with deployment
```

### 4. Stakeholder Updates
```bash
*status
→ Share feature completion report
→ Present recommended next steps
→ Plan roadmap meeting
```

### 5. Post-Completion
```bash
*status
→ Identify next priority actions
→ Create next epic (*create-epic)
→ Update team on progress
```

## Integration with PM Workflows

### Creating PRDs Based on Status
```bash
*status
→ Review "Create Post-Launch Roadmap" recommendation
→ *create-brownfield-prd
→ Build Phase 2 requirements
```

### Sprint Planning
```bash
*status
→ Review feature completion
→ *create-epic (for next sprint)
→ Delegate to @sm for story creation
```

### Course Correction
```bash
*status

## Tips & Tricks

### Use in Scripts
```bash
# Automatic status check in CI/CD
node .aios-core/development/scripts/pm-project-status.js > status-report.txt
```

### Team Communication
```bash
# Share status with team before standup
*status > status-report.md
# Distribute via Slack/Email
```

### Dashboard Integration
```bash
# Export for monitoring
node .aios-core/development/scripts/pm-project-status.js > /tmp/bidiq-status.json
```

### Custom Filtering
```bash
# Show just deployment status
*status | grep -A 8 "DEPLOYMENT READINESS"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Status shows "unknown" for some metrics**
A: Check if test coverage reports exist. Run tests first:
```bash
cd backend && pytest --cov
cd frontend && npm test:coverage
```

**Q: Git information not showing correctly**
A: Ensure git is configured:
```bash
git config user.email "your@email.com"
git log -1 (should show recent commits)
```

**Q: Deployment status shows incomplete**
A: Verify files exist:
```bash
ls backend/railway.toml        # Should exist
ls docs/DEPLOYMENT.md          # Should exist
```

## Performance

The `*status` command:
